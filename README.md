# Summary:
Game is a Top-Down perspective RPG. Game is divided into multiple maps and our goal is to move through the story map by map with our chosen character, completing given primary quests in each map. These quests may range between rescuing NPC's, eliminating key targets, recovering items (etc.). Aside from the main questline, there will be secondary quests that help the character gain money and/or items. Money will help the players improve their character via purchasing new items, consumables and in Wizard's case, learning new spells.

Player chooses a premade character at the start of the game. Each character starts with a unique set of abilities and items they can use. Each character has a different set of items they can use throughout the game.

# Gameplay
- Game is a 90 degrees top-down, low poly 3D action RPG game.
- Object/Character interaction key is "E".
- Player controls a single character. Character moves using WASD keys and follows the mouse-controlled Crosshair. All attacks and abilities follow the mouse-controlled crosshair..
- Characters have 2 different abilities depending on the item currently equipped. LMB activates the primary ability of the equipped item while RMB activates the secondary.
- Each character can carry up to 5 items.
- Select items from the Character's inventory using 1-2-3-4-5 number keys. Players may organize their inventory slots before entering a level. 
- Each weapon or item has different abilities. For example: While with sword & shield, LMB is quick a sword swing  and RMB is closing the shield, with a halberd, LMB may be a wide swing and RMB is a longer ranged thrust. Wizard's situation is unique among the other characters. His only item will be the Staff. Wizard's item slots will be occupied with prepared spells. These spells will be selected by the coreresponding number key and used with LMB. Spells will have Mana costs and Cooldowns.  Additionally, before entering a level, Wizard will choose 2 cantrips to place on LMB or RMB. For example, LMB may be - Fire Bolt and RMB may be Arcane Shield. These cantrips will only have cooldowns and not Mana Costs. When the Wizard selects a spell, his Staff will start glowing. With LMB, spell will be cast.
- Each character will have 2 bars underneath the screen. Resource and Health. Resource is different in each Character. For example while Mercenary and Legionary may have Stamina Bars, Wizard may have a Mana bar and Sharpshooter may have a Focus Bar. While Stamina and Focus regenerates, Mana doesn't.
